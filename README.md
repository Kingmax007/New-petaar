"Petnaar" creates a dynamic online community where pet enthusiasts can connect, exchange experiences, and access essential resources, thereby cultivating a supportive and interactive environment. 
The foundation of "Petnaar's" development necessitates a thorough exploration of existing literature on pet ownership in Estonia, examining pet owners' characteristics and preferences, and evaluating the role of social applications in nurturing such communities.
